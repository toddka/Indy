A 3D Billiards game I created using JavaFX.
It features collision detection, realistic collision physics, multiple game modes, and 3D objects.

To Run: Download and extract the ZIP file and make sure the folder is named "Indy". Open cmd and run the command 
YourDirectory>Indy>javac -cp .;lib cs015.jar *.java
Then, go to YourDirectory and run the command
YourDirectory>java Indy.App
The game should launch if you have a recent version of Java. We had to create a class path while compiling to
use a jar file that helps with save/load features of the program.
